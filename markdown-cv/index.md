## Who Am I

I'm a software developer since 2011, for 3 years I worked on **mobile applications** for iOS and Android devices and I achieved a good level of experience with Android Studio and Xcode IDEs, with the most used programming patterns and with various frameworks.
In 2014 I started working in **Python** with the **Django** framework, over the course of a couple of years I greatly improved my skills until I started designing, developing, and maintaining the **Realisti.co** web application with its REST API, obtaining almost 100% of test coverage and setting up the GitHub Action pipeline for CI. I also designed and maintained a 10-machine **AWS infrastructure** using **Ansible** and improved and maintained a deployment script that allows you to deploy without downtime.
In 2020 Casavo acquired Realisti.co and I started my experience in a hypergrowth company that allowed me to increase my **DevOps** and **leadership** skills by leading 6 people to build a **user-centric** product from an existing legacy codebase.

## Extra skills

- Software security: I've done some CTF and security assessments
- Electronics: in my spare time I've designed PCBs for personal projects
- Embedded systems: I made the porting of an existing firmware on GigaDevice MCU
- Reverse engineering: I like to teardown things, analyze them, find debug interfaces and try to reverse the firmware
