# [ci8.it](http://ci8.it/)

This repo is for my personal site [ci8.it](https://ci8.it/), based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The dynamic part is in the `src` folder.

For site generation use:

```bash
make build
```

For local test use:

```bash
make runserver
```
